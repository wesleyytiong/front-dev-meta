  "description": "- FP is a paradigm of coding, using functions and variables - It keeps data and functionality separate  - Passes data into functions only when we want something computed * Const, let, var 1) const - use by default. Enforces immutability and limits unintended state changes 2) let - need to reassign varaibles scoped within a block (e.g. for loops or local state within function) 3) var - function-level scope -> can lead to issues like hoisting",
